# 🎬 FilmFetch – A Movie Search App 🍿

Wanna flex your film knowledge or just stalk IMDb like a boss?  
This tiny project lets you search any movie and instantly fetches juicy details using the **OMDB API**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔎 Search any movie by name
- 🖼️ See poster, title, ratings, plot & more
- 📡 Powered by the mighty OMDB API
- 💻 All in vanilla HTML, CSS & JS (no frameworks, no drama)

---

## 🧠 What I Did
- Learned what an API is (finally 🙃)
- Figured out how to **fetch** stuff like a proper dev
- Did not cry (too much) debugging fetch calls

---

## ⚠️ Note
Yes, I’ve **hardcoded my own API key** like a rebel.  
It’s just a free one, no biggie — but if it ever stops working, blame the internet (or me).

> 🧑‍💻 You’re welcome to fork this project — but seriously, [get your own OMDB key](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) and replace mine in `script.js`:
```js
const apiKey = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY";
